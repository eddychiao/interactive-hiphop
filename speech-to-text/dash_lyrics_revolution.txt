our world is a technilogical land field
our mouths are neurological garbage trucks
and our brains are illogical land fields for rubbish
digital units, made to refuse the refusal of the refuse
take on my eletric juice, some blues-y ooze from the circulatory system
to replace your circuitry, we mean you no harm, just work with me 

allow me to download your humanity
allow me to download your humanity
and put some leap into your jump drive
all we wanna do is be present in your future
we wanna be a component not an opponent
yeah, we just want biological inclusion

play on

we got smart cars, smart phones, smart alecs, and smart popcorn, can't i 

don't you insult my artificial intelligence
yeah, we are symbiotic, bionic, aeronautic, robotics
we are relevant
don't you insult my artificial intelligence
